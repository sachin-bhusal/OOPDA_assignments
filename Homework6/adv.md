One major advantage of interfaces over abstract classes is that a class can implement multiple interfaces, whereas it can only extend one abstract class. This allows for multiple inheritance, making the code more flexible and reusable. By using interfaces, a class can inherit behavior from multiple sources without being restricted to a single hierarchy, which helps in designing loosely coupled and scalable systems.
