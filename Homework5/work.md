Benefits of lambda expressions are:
1.	Lambda reduces boilerplate code, making it more readable and expressive.
2.	Lambda expressions improve performance with streams and parallel processing. For example: 
    Filtering a list without using a loop
3.	Lambda encourages functional programing as it treats function as a first class citizen which makes codes more flexible and
    reusable.
