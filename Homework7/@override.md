The @Override annotation in Java is used to indicate that a method in a subclass is overriding a method from its superclass. It helps ensure correctness by allowing the compiler to check if the method signature exactly matches the one in the parent class. If there is a mismatch due to a typo or incorrect method parameters, the compiler generates an error. This annotation improves code readability and prevents accidental method overloading instead of overriding. While not mandatory, using @Override is a good practice to avoid errors and make the code more maintainable.
