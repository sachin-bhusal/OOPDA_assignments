The toString() and equals() methods are inherited by all Java objects from the Object class. By default, toString() returns the class name and memory address, but overriding it provides a meaningful string representation of an object's attributes. The equals() method, by default, checks reference equality, but overriding it allows for logical comparison based on attribute values. This is crucial for proper functionality in collections like HashSet and ArrayList. Overriding these methods enhances readability, debugging, and ensures accurate object comparisons.
